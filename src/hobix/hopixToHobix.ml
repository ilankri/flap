(** The compilation environment.
    ———————————————————————————–

    To translate a program written in a source language into another
    semantically equivalent program written in a target language, it
    is convenient to carry some information about the correspondence
    between the two programs along the process. The compilation
    environment is meant to that.

    In this particular pass, we want to remember an assignment of
    integers to constructor identifiers. Therefore, the compilation
    environment is composed of a map representing this assignment. The
    environment is populated each time we cross a type definitions while
    it is read each time we translate language constructions related to
    tagged values.
*)

module ConstructorMap = Map.Make (struct
    type t = HopixAST.constructor
    let compare = compare
  end)

type environment = {
  constructor_tags : Int32.t ConstructorMap.t;
}

let initial_environment () = {
  constructor_tags = ConstructorMap.empty;
}

let index_of_constructor env k =
  try ConstructorMap.find k env.constructor_tags with
  | Not_found -> assert false   (* By typing.  *)

(** Code generation
    ———————————————

    A compilation pass produces code. We could directly
    write down caml expressions made of applications of
    HobixAST constructors. Yet, the resulting code would
    be ugly...

    A better way consists in defining functions that build
    Hobix AST terms and are convenient to use. Here are a
    list of functions that may be convenient to you when
    you will implement this pass.
