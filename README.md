# Overview of features
## Fully implemented
* Typechecker for Hopix
* Compiler from Hopix to Hobix
* Compiler from Hobix to Fopix
* Compiler from Fopix to Retrolix (without calling conventions)

## Partially implemented
* Compiler from Retrolix to MIPS assembly language
* Register allocation (only the liveness analysis is implemented)

## To be fixed
Compilation of operations on blocks in Retrolix/MIPS: there maybe
a problem with procedure call conventions because operations on blocks
are OK up to Retrolix but some programs that use operations on blocks
are successfully executed on MIPS architecture.

## To be implemented
* Graph coloring of interference graph (to complete register allocation)
* Handling of strings and chars
* Type inference for Hopix
* Various optimizations like efficient compilation of pattern matching
  or tail call optimization

# How to test the generated code
Install:
- qemu-system-mips
- sshpass

1. Run './download.sh' to get the Qemu images.
2. Run './start.sh' to start a VM.
3. Run './configure.sh' to install gcc and gdb on the VM.
4. Run './install.sh' each time you want to install runtime.c on the VM.
5. Run './run.sh foo.hopix' each time you want to compile and execute foo.hopix to MIPS on the VM.
